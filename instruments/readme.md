You will want some kind of IDE which is capable of sending code to a REPL instance.

There are many paths to getting this setup. 
The most walked make our journey easier, 
but there is nothing stopping you going off on your own.

### Vim

Plugins for interacting with a REPL with Clojure:

* [vim-clojure-static](https://github.com/guns/vim-clojure-static)
