You have at your hands the capability to make every sound imaginable.

```clojure
(definst creativity [amp 9999] (* amp (lf-saw 300)))
```

Unplug those headphones,

```
d[-_-]b
  /█\
  .Π.
```

adjust your volume

```
█ ▆ ▅ ▃  Volume @ 50%
```

and your ears are ready to begin their journey.


##> Before you begin

```
git clone git@github.com:josephwilk/strangeloop2014.git && cd strangeloop2014 && make
```

##> You reach a fork in the road

```
   -----          -------
  |Power|        |Freedom|
   -----          -------
    \   \         /   /
     \   \       /   /
      \   \     /   /
       \   \   /   /
        \   :?    / 
         \  /█\  /
          \ .Π. /  

One path leads to instant power but you are never truely free.
The other leads to complete freedom but you have to build your world from scratch.
